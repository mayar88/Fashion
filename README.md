# Clothes Recommendation System using DenseNet121

This project implements a clothes recommendation system based on visual similarity using the DenseNet121 architecture. It analyzes images of clothing items and recommends similar items based on their visual features. The system was built using pre-trained DenseNet121 from the Keras library, fine-tuned on the Fashion MNIST dataset, and employs feature extraction for similarity matching.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to provide a recommendation engine for clothing items based on image similarity. The DenseNet121 model, a deep learning convolutional neural network, is used for extracting deep features from images, which are then compared to suggest similar clothing.

### Key Features:
- **Image Preprocessing**: Clothing images are preprocessed (resized, normalized) to be compatible with the DenseNet121 input layer.
- **Feature Extraction**: DenseNet121, pre-trained on ImageNet, is used to extract rich visual features from the clothing images.
- **Similarity Matching**: Cosine similarity is calculated between the extracted features to recommend items visually similar to a given input.
- **User Input**: Users can upload a clothing item image to receive recommendations for similar items.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of clothing images from the **Fashion MNIST** dataset. The images are grayscale with a fixed size of 28x28 pixels. The dataset contains 60,000 training samples and 10,000 test samples, covering 10 different clothing categories such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, etc.

You can also experiment with larger or custom datasets to enhance the recommendation system.

## Model Architecture

The model uses the **DenseNet121** architecture for feature extraction. DenseNet121 is a convolutional neural network known for its dense connections between layers, enabling the reuse of features and improving gradient flow.

The pre-trained DenseNet121 model, fine-tuned for this task, ensures that it leverages learned representations from the ImageNet dataset, making it effective for general-purpose feature extraction.

## How It Works

1. **Image Input**: The system takes an image of a clothing item as input.
2. **Feature Extraction**: DenseNet121 extracts a feature vector from the image.
3. **Similarity Calculation**: Cosine similarity between the input image's feature vector and other images' feature vectors is computed.
4. **Recommendation**: The top N items with the highest similarity scores are recommended to the user.

## Installation

### Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (optional, for image processing)

## Future Improvements

- **Integration with E-commerce**: Build a recommendation system that can be integrated into e-commerce platforms.
- **Larger Datasets**: Train the model with a larger, more diverse dataset for better generalization.
- **User Preferences**: Incorporate user preferences (e.g., style, brand) into the recommendation system for personalized results.
